# The GOTH Programming Language

GOTH is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software. Think of it as the same as Go, but with less
dogma about remaining backwards-compatible. 

## GOTH is going to be the solution to Go's inherent flaws that continue to remain.
G.O.T.H stands for "Go, Only Thoughfully Helpful". This is because the person who 
started this fork of Go, Jonathan McCormick, Jr., was learning Go and was irritated 
by the fact that Go has a function called `string()` which is named deceptively. 
Instead of casting an integer or float to a string (which is what its name suggests), 
the `string()` function ACTUALLY converts an integer to a Unicode character. 

Ridiculous, right?

GOTH is a work in progress. If you see room for improvement, feel free to do a pull request or make a comment. 

## GOTH IS NOT YET OPERATIONAL.
